You also had a meeting with local Fish and Wildlife offices, where you discussed waterfowl hunting permits in nearby salt marshes. Hunting doesn't take place in the reserve but is allowed in neighboring marshlands, and birds often move between the areas. Officials mention that these neighboring marshlands are hotspots for hunting, which generate important conservation resources through fees and permits. They request that your department surveys the waterfowl population in the reserve, and take any necessary actions to maintain stable populations.",

You identified 107 species in the reserve and have watched them interact with each other. Last week you attended a seminar on the impacts of climate change on coastal wetlands. You  learned that as sea levels rise, salt marsh plants move upland, potentially taking over previously forested or suburban areas, or squeezing salt marshes out of existence (called 'coastal squeeze'). Climate change can also play a major role in increasing soil salinity by increasing the rate or evaporation. ",
      objective:
        "Increasing soil salinty can lead to changes in community structure and function. There is also evidence that increased soil salinty can lead to increased below ground biomass, which is linked to carbon storage.
